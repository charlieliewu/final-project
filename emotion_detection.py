# emotion_detection.py

# Assuming you have an emotion detection module or API function available, let's import it.    
# For example, we assume there is a function named detect_emotion that processes the text.

# Example: from some_emotion_detection_module import detect_emotion

# Function to perform emotion detection
def emotion_detector(text_to_analyze):
    """
    This function takes text as input and returns the detected emotion based on the
    emotion detection function.
    
    :param text_to_analyze: The text that needs to be analyzed for emotion.
    :return: The detected emotion text.
    """
    # Call the emotion detection function (assume it's called detect_emotion)
    # The response object from this function has a `text` attribute that holds the result.
    
    response = detect_emotion(text_to_analyze)
    
    # Return the emotion text from the response object  
    return response.text

# Example usage (This part is not necessary in the file, but here to demonstrate usage)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    sample_text = "I am feeling really happy today!"
    emotion = emotion_detector(sample_text)
